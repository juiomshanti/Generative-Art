# Generative-Art

I want to draw attention to how the rate of greenhouse gas emissions have increased in the last decade and how drastically it will keep on increasing in the coming years. Global warming is therefore not a myth. It is very real and it is high time to take action. The main cause of global warming - CO2 and similar greenhouse gas data is a proof that I used for generating bedsheet designs algorithmically. Putting this data as an art over a bedsheet is a constant reminder to people that the environment where they live and breathe is in danger.

I wanted the bedsheet design to be a reminder that global warming is real and right in front of our eyes. It shows that even if you choose to ignore it the place where you sleep is in danger.
