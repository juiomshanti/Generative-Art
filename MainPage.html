    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Bedsheet Pollution Designs</h1>
    <p>These are some bedsheet design ideas based on the air pollution data of your location. The <i>colors</i> are designed based on <b>CO,O3 and NO2</b> levels in air. The <i>shapes</i> are designed based on the <b>SO2</b> concentration in the air.
    The triangles represent a lower concentration of SO2 in the air while the semi-circles and circles represent a higher concentration of SO2. The colors of these shapes are based on the rgb values that we derive from CO,O3 and NO2 concentrations respectively. The grid colors in the background are randomly generated, click anywhere on the screen to change it.
    <br><br>Press the arrow down key to decrease the grid size or Press the arrow up key to increase the grid size.</p>
